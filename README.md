# MultiThreading-Timing-Test
Multiple Tests to try out which tasks benefit the most from multi-threading 🕵️‍♂️

## Results:
- Counting: No Difference (Multi-Threading and Non-Threading took nearly the same time)
- Reading Files (CSV): Little Difference (Multi-Threading was slightly faster than Non-Threading, maybe one or two seconds)
- Opening Websites (Requests): Big Difference (Multi-Threading was more than 10x faster than Non-Threading)

###### My next crawler is definitely going to have multi-threading built-in, <br> and also it sounds cool!
